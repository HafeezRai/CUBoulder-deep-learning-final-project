# Deep Learning CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify 32x32 color images into 10 different categories.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete deep learning project for image classification, including:
- Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of CNN models with varying complexity
- Model training and evaluation
- Detailed performance analysis
- Business insights and recommendations

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck
